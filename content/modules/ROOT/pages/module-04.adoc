== Regenerate SSL certificate

To comply with the system-wide cryptographic policy of FUTURE, you will
need to generate a replacement SSL certificate using an RSA key of at
least 3072 bit length, or longer.

Make directory for private key

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /etc/ssl/private/
----

The new RSA certificate will use a public key of 4096 bits.

[source,bash]
----
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/CN=${HOSTNAME}" -keyout /etc/ssl/private/mssql.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/mssql.pem -days 365
----

Generating a RSA private key ……………………………………………….++++
……………………………………….++++ writing new private key to '`mssql.key`' —–

....

Change the owner of the key files to the mssql user and group

```bash
chown mssql:mssql /etc/ssl/private/mssql.key /etc/ssl/certs/mssql.pem
....

Verify the bit-length of the key to confirm that it is 4096 bit.

[source,bash]
----
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/mssql.pem -text | grep bit
----

RSA Public-Key: (4096 bit) ```

Now that a new SSL certificate has been created using a larger public
key, it complies with the requirements of the FUTURE cryptographic
policy.

____
*NOTE:* It is recommended practice to use Certificate Authority (CA)
issued certificates. If you were using a certificate from a Certificate
Authority, you would need to generate a new Certificate Signature
Request (csr) and submit it to your CA. When you receive the signed
certificate from your CA, you would then position it, and update any
configuration files needed to reference it.
