== Connect to SQL Server with updated certificate

Tune SQL Server configuration to read the new key files, and force
encryption only from client

* Set the network.tlscert configuration variable to point to the public
key

[source,bash]
----
/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set network.tlscert /etc/ssl/certs/mssql.pem
----

* Set the network.tlskey configuration variable to point to the private
key

[source,bash]
----
/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set network.tlskey /etc/ssl/private/mssql.key
----

* Set the network.forceencryption configuration variable to 1 (initiated
by client)

[source,bash]
----
/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set network.forceencryption 1
----

Restart the SQL Server service

[source,bash]
----
systemctl restart mssql-server.service
----

Now that the service certificates comply with the policy, the client
should be able to connect without any issue, and the connection should
be encrypted

[source,bash]
----
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P Redhat1! -N -C -Q "select session_id, encrypt_option from sys.dm_exec_connections where session_id = @@spid"
----

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|===
|session_id |encrypt_option
|XX |TRUE
|===
